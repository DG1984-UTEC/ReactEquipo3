## Code review dynamics and merging strategies

In order to have clean code in the project, we had an agreement on what functionality each member of the group had to work with. When we had advances on those components we pushed it to the branch we are working on, in favor of having the repository updated. 
Then we noticed the group through a whatsapp group and we created a pull request in git. When the reviewer considered that the code was correct and does not generate trouble in main, we merged.
